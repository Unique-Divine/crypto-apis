# crypto-apis

You'll neeed to configure API keys in order to use various components of the repo. For now, this is done via the creation of a short Python file, `crypto_apis/secret_api_keys`, which must contain the following constants:
```python
# crypto_apis/secret_api_keys.py
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY = ""
COINMARKETCAP_API_KEY = ""
```

You'll also need to configure your Messari API key inside of the package.
